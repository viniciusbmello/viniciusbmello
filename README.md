## Profile

My journey in IT started in childhood. My aunt had opened a computer school and started by supporting there. As a teenager, I started playing some MMORPG games and soon wanted to create my own servers of these games, and consequently I needed to learn about virtualization, programming and database. And that was when I needed to make my first websites so people could find my servers.

When I finished high school, I was sure that I wanted to continue studying about IT and in the first semester of my graduation we had to program a CPP Sudoku, I remember that very fondly. At the end of the course, in front of the Final Paper, I decided to make a Geolocation System based on the Intensity and Angle of arrival of the signal from the WiFi routers on the Campus. It was a huge challenge, but also a huge achievement. 

I've been working for more than 10 years in the IT field with numerous challenges overcome and after all this, I can say that I love innovation and dynamism. I'm passionate about creating things, set goals and achieve them.
